# Stacks and Queues

Stack
* two basic operations: push and pop
* elements are added (push) and removed (pop) in last-in, first-out order
    * if stack is empty pop returns NULL or throws an exception
    * useful for creating reverse iterators for sequences which are difficult or impossible to step back from
